WHAT IS VIVI?

 Vivi is a boot loader for ARM processors.

DOCUMENTATON:

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

CONFIGUREING:

 - Do a "make config" to configure the vivi. "make config" needs
   bash to work: it will search for bash in $BASH. /bin/bash and /bin/sh
   (in the order), so one of those must be correct for it to work.

   Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor
   version. New configuration options are added in each release, and
   odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up
   as expected. If you want to carry your existing configuration to a
   new version with minimal work, use "make oldconfig", which will
   only ask you for the answers to new questions.

 - Alternate configuration commands are:
        "make menuconfig"  Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.
        "make oldconfig"   Default all questions based on the contents of
                           your existing ./.config file.

 - Check the top Makefile for further site-dependent configuration.

COMPILING:

 - Do a "make vivi" to create a vivi. all done.
